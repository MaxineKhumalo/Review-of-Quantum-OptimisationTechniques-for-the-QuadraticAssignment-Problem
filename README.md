# Review of Quantum Optimisation Techniques for the Quadratic Assignment Problem

This repo contains the code used in my MSc Computer Science project at the University of the Witwatersrand.

# What is inside this Repository

So instructions for the user

### Data

The csv files from QAPLIB can be found in `/data/*`.

There are a two types of data files; namely:

* Data from QAPLIB with the first three letters referencing the paper and a number giving the problem size (e.g. bur26a.csv is a dataset from a paper by R.E. Burkard with 26 locations.)
* Randomly generated data with the number referencing the problem size (e.g. made4.csv is a randomly generated matrix of size 4)


# How to use

How can someone else use this repo to reproduce your results....
